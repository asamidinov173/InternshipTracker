# Internship Tracker
This project is part of my preparation for a Spring internship. InternshipTracker provides a simple, clean interface where users can view all their internship applications, track statuses (Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected), add notes, and manage their workflow efficiently.
It showcases my ability to build real-world tools while following good development practices, API design, and modern full-stack architecture.
